## Overview
- Check [[Sets, Intervals, Pairs]] for a general overview of some mathematical concepts

# Logic
- Check [here](https://mfleck.cs.illinois.edu/building-blocks/version-1.3/logic.pdf)
- 2 Systems of logic are commonly used in logic: [[Proposition|Propositional]] logic and [[Predicate]] logic.
- [[Proposition#Complex Proposition|Complex Propositions]] --> Combination of prepositions
- [[Logic Symbols|Logic Notations]] --> Can define relations between propositions, such as "OR", "AND"
- [[Conditional Statement]] --> If $p$, then $q$
- [[Logical Equivalence]] --> Shows that 2 different looking propositions can be equal if they are true for exactly the same outputs
- [[Predicates]] --> Allows variables and predicates that take variables as input
- [[Quantifiers]] --> Expresses how many of the values in the domain make the claim true

## Binding
- *Binding* -->  A quantifier binds the variable it defines, such as $∀$ in $∀x ∈ R, x² + 3 ≥ 0$
- *Scope* --> The scope of a bound variable is the part of the statement where the variable is defined. It usually ends at the end of the statement or line
- *Free Variables* --> Variables not bound by a quantifier or given a value are called free variables and don’t have a defined truth value
- *Politeness in Writing* --> Always define variables and their types to avoid confusion, similar to declaring variables in programming
