## Quantifiers
- Expresses how many of the values in the domain make the claim true
-  Used to express the extent to which a predicate is true over a range of elements
- $¬(∀x, P(x)) ≡ ∃x, ¬P(x)$

#### Useful Notation
- This --> $∀x ∈ R, ∀y ∈ R, x + y ≥ x$
- Is usually abbreviated to --> $∀x, y ∈ R, x + y ≥ x$ (which is false)

#### Notation for 2D Points
- This (which is true) --> $∃(x, y) ∈ R 2 , x2 + y 2 = 1$
- Can also be --> $∃p ∈ R^2 , p$ is on the unit circl

### Universal Quantifier ($\forall$):
   - Denoted by the symbol $\forall$.
   - It means "for all" or "for every".
   - Example: $\forall x \in \mathbb{N}, x + 0 = x$ (For all natural numbers $x$, $x + 0 = x$).

### Existential Quantifier ($\exists$):
   - Denoted by the symbol $\exists$.
   - It means "there exists" or "for some".
   - Example: $\exists x \in \mathbb{R}, x^2 = 4$ (There exists a real number $x$ such that $x^2 = 4$).

### Unique Existence Quantifier ($\exists!$):
- Denoted by the symbol $\exists!$
- It means "There exists exactly one" or "There is a unique"
- Example: $\exists! x \in \mathbb{R}, x^2 = 1$ (There exists exactly one real number $x$ such that $x^2 = 1$).
