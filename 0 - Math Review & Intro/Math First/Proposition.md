## Proposition
- A statement that is `true` or `false` (but never both)
	- ex: Urbana is in Illinois” or $2 ≤ 15$
	- ex: This is *not* a proposition: $x < 9$ (because of variable)
	- ex: This is *not* a proposition: $5+7$ (not a claim)

## Complex Proposition
- A combination of 1 or more [[Proposition]]s.
- ex: "Urbana is in Illinois and Margaret was born in Wisconsin"
	- $p$ is "Urbana is in Illinois"
	- $q$ is "Margarent was born in Wisconsin"
	- This would be “$p$ and $q$” --> $p ∧ q$
