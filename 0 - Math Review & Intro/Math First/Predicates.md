## Predicates and Variables
- A *predicate* is a statement that becomes true or false if you substitute in values for its variables
- ex: $P(x)$ is true for every $x$
	- For every integer $x, x^2 â‰¥ 10$ (`false`), depends
- To determine if a *predicate* is true or not, need to determine what values are allowed for each variable (e.g. input field)
